Answer the questions posted in the instructions here.

Question 1:

(a) A SIGSEGV signal (segmentation fault) is received. iogetline.c is complaining.


(b) The segmentation fault is received at line 320 when trying to run the function printFileToConsole3().

Problem 2: When trying to run printFileToConsole3, fgetlines() is called, which in turn calls fgetline. The 
root cause of the error in problem 1 occurs in fgetlin() when fgets is called; this is where the seg fault
occurs.

Problem 4: The error was occuring in the function fgetlines() because it never allocates memory for the
char *nextLine string the first time it calls fgetline(). The problem was fixed by adding an allocation
of memory via a call to calloc at line 65 in file-functions.c.
